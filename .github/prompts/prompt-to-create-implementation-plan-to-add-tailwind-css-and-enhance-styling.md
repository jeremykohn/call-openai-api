Create an implementation plan for the update that is described in application-specifications-update-1.md in the .github directory.

In the implementation plan, describe the approach you will take in detail, but do not write any code yet.

The implementation plan should use Test-Driven Development (TDD) including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests, with a red-green-refactor loop for writing tests and testing code.

Save the implementation plan to a new file implementation-plan-to add-tailwind-css-and-enhance-styling.md in the .github directory.
